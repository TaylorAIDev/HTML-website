	<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
	<p>These Terms contain a dispute resolution and arbitration provision, including class action waiver, which affects
		your rights under these Terms and with respect to any dispute you may have with Konnect. You may opt out of the
		binding individual arbitration and class action waiver as provided below.</p>
	<p><strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver.</strong> Please read the following provision
		(the “Provision”) carefully. This agreement requires you to arbitrate disputes with Konnect and it otherwise
		limits the ways you can seek remedies from us. Many customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a
		customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at http://konnectapp.com. We ask that you please contact us if you have
		any concerns. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise
		between you and Konnect. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute
		waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes
		to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt­out of this
		Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court,
		either before a judge or jury. This provision provides that all Disputes between you and Konnect shall be
		resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this
		arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge
		or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not
		limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of
		your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in
		arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and
		can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).</p>
	<p>Arbitration will be administered by and governed by the rules the American Arbitration Association. This
		Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration
		Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings. The FAA and
		AAA Rules will preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found
		to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that
		issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Texas . It is your responsibility to pay any AAA Filing
		Fee, administrator fee, or arbitrator fee.</p>
	<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN
		THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE
		WITH THIS PROVISION. WE FURTHER AGREE THAT PRIOR TO REQUESTING OR COMMENCING AN ACTION IN ARBITRATION, YOU WILL
		FIRST GIVE KONNECT AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.</p>
